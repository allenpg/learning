# Tutorial: Add a Dataset to Data Together

_Note: This tutorial is a work in progress. Please add your feedback to [datatogether/learning](https://github.com/datatogether/learning/issues)!_

## Prerequisites

* You care about a dataset that exists on the web -- that's it :)

## Learning Objectives

After going through this tutorial you will know how to:

* Add a dataset to Data Together for harvesting
* Create an account on Data Together
* Explain the difference between adding, harvesting, and storing datasets with Data Together
* Describe how Data Together helps groups to steward data they care about

****

### Step 1. Get information about a dataset

* Consider the dataset that you would like to archive on Data Together.
* Make note of the **name** and **web address** or [**URL** ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL) where the dataset can be accessed.
* In addition but without spending too much time, make note of contextual information such as what you use the data for, why the data was collected (and by who), what date it was published.

An example would be EPA's National Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventory, currently located at https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-greenhouse-gas-emission-inventory.

### Step 2. Register on Data Together _(optional)_

* Register on Data Together by visiting https://archivers.co/signup

### Step 4. Explore the concepts of data stewardship that underly Data Together

* **Public Record** means a shared record of the information that has been published by the plethora of entities on the web.
* **Distributed Data Stewardship** means is using distributed technologies to secure & provide access to data that you care about.

## Next Steps

Move to the next tutorials on how to:

* Replicate a dataset you care about onto hardware that you control
* Browse datasets that have been backed up
